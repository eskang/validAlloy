This document contains some hints for using the Alloy API:

1. Unzip the Alloy jar file in ../lib using "jar xvf" to extract the source 
code for Alloy.

2. Import the Alloy source code into Eclipse (or your favorite Java IDE).

3. The file "edu/mit/csail/sdg/alloy4whole/ExampleUsingTheAPI.java" 
contains an example of how to use the API to run Alloy on an input file 
and generate an instance. The file only prints out the instance, but there 
are API functions that you can use to extract different parts of the 
instance. For a more detailed documentation, take a look here (especially 
at A4Solution class):
