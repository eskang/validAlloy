FileSystemBuilder.java has our current work on trying to create the File System from the instance given by Alloy

We have a problem, we cant create our run command in java, when we try to execute them, the facts are ignored.
In Order to bypass this problem we declared the run command that we pretended to use on the git_dynamic.als file that also contains the model.
